The concept the author (Barney Dellar) is working with is "Strong Types in C++", where he uses the infamous mars rover crash
"Europe's Schiaparelli Mars Lander" where the fault has been determined to be due to wrong measurement types (imperial vs
SI units).
Although changing the units is an important factor there is a greater lesson here about creating the types that you will be
working with in order to force constraints on the user.
